## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the REIST (Redundant Signed Integer) arithmetic implementation compared to classical modular arithmetic operations. Benchmarks were run with two compiler optimization levels:

- **O0**: No optimization (baseline)
- **O3**: Full optimization with architecture-specific tuning

## Performance Overview

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **REIST arithmetic consistently outperforms classical modular arithmetic** across various scenarios, particularly for non-power-of-two moduli.

2. **Compiler optimizations (O3) significantly impact both implementations**, though REIST maintains its advantage in most cases.

3. **The speedup increases with larger moduli**, demonstrating REIST's efficiency for cryptographic operations requiring large prime moduli.

4. **Hardware-specific optimizations** (NEON on ARM, AVX on x86) could further enhance REIST performance.

### Recommendations

- **Use REIST for cryptographic primitives** requiring frequent modular operations
- **Enable compiler optimizations** to maximize both REIST and classical performance
- **Consider hardware acceleration** for production deployments
- **Profile specific use cases** to validate performance gains in real-world scenarios
